# Static Site Example

This is the static site example that follows the documentation at [docs.decycl.es](https://docs.decycl.es/application-developer/examples/static-site.html). Feel free to clone this template as a starting point for your Decycles static site application.

In this example, the `site` folder is your web root. Just put your static content in this folder.
